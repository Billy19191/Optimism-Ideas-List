# Please explain alignment with the relevant Intent

The mission proposal is strategically aligned with Intent #4: Enhance Governance Accessibility. Its fundamental objective revolves around the provision of specialized tooling and infrastructure designed to implement incentives, with a clear goal of expanding the votable supply of OP.

Furthermore, the open-source nature of the SDK underpins this missionâ€™s objective to motivate developers to engage with these tools for executing various controlled governance experiments. By concurrently supporting governance incentives and tool development, we are confident that this mission will significantly influence governance contributors, researchers, and the evolution of future tooling. This initiative is anticipated to have a direct and meaningful impact on the ease of governance participation on the OP mainnet.
